
Conclusion and Next Steps (Deep Learning with OpenCV + PyTorch/TensorFlow)

Concept: You built a solid base in image processing. Next, use OpenCV to prepare data and visualize results for deep learning with PyTorch or TensorFlow.

Visualization: Console prints with guidance and links you can add later.

Practice Exercise: Install PyTorch or TensorFlow and load a pretrained classifier to run on frames.

Real-world Application: End-to-end CV systems mix classic image ops with deep learning inference.

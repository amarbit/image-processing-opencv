### Conclusion and Next Steps (Deep Learning with OpenCV + PyTorch/TensorFlow)

**Concept**: You built a solid base in image processing. Next, use OpenCV to prepare data and visualize results for deep learning with PyTorch or TensorFlow.

**Hands-on Code Example**:
```python
print("Congrats! You completed the OpenCV Image Processing series.")
print("Next: explore OpenCV DNN module, PyTorch/TensorFlow integration, and pretrained models.")
```

**What you will see**: Console prints with guidance and links you can add later.

**Practice exercise**: Install PyTorch or TensorFlow and load a pretrained classifier to run on frames.

**Real-world application**: End-to-end CV systems mix classic image ops with deep learning inference.
